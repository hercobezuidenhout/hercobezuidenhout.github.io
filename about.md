Hi ðŸ‘‹!

My name is Herco Bezuidenhout and I am a senior software engineer based in Cape Town.

While I have many passions, my biggest one is probably my passion for code. Building products to be exact. What I love about building products is the feeling of putting something out there and seeing how people use it. Then, refine it until it is as close to perfect as possible.

My first project was a mobile game I built using Unity back when I was 16 years old. I published the game to the Google Play Store and watched how it was downloaded by a couple hundred people. I played the game myself and enjoyed it!

I soon moved into the app and business space because I realized that is where the money lies.

Entering into the freelance world in 2018, I worked with some amazing companies including [V8 Media](https://v8media.co.za/), [Planet Fitness](https://www.planetfitness.co.za/) and [iLead Et Al](https://www.ileadetal.co.za/) to name a few. Unfortunately, I found myself in some scary legal conversations in 2019 and decided to take a break from freelancing.

I focused on my studies at [Belgium Campus iTversity](https://www.belgiumcampus.ac.za/) and graduated with a Cum Laude in Bachelors of Computing.

Since 2021, I have been working for [Entelect](https://entelect.co.za/). While working for Entelect, I have helped [Anglo American](https://www.angloamerican.com/) build projects where I worked with ReactJS, .NET and Microsoft Azure. I have since started helping [Capitec Bank](https://www.capitecbank.co.za/) delivery new features on their mobile app.

I have also:

1. Built [Doinfine](https://doinfine.app).
2. Won [Entelect Tech Accelerator 2023](https://businesstech.co.za/news/industry-news/734487/entelect-tech-accelerator-enters-10th-year-with-its-largest-number-of-entrants-yet/).
3. Started my first newsletter, [LaunchWeek](https://launchweek.co.za).

My current goals are to continue helping Entelect become the best software development company in the world and improve my craft as a software engineer.
